# covid-calc
A simple calculator to help people understand the semester grade calculations at Mayfield High School, enacted in spring 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Basics:
This is a single-page that calculates semester scores with vanilla Javascript. The page styles are mostly from Bootstrap, just to make the build faster. It is important to note that this page does not use any cookies, to avoid storing any user data. 

Anyone can use this page, and for any reason. It is worth noting that the calculations are done here for estimations, and they do not set in stone the scores a student will recieve. This is always subject to teacher discretion.
